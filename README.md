# React-Native-Drawer-Sub-Menu
We learned to build a multi-level drawer menu with React Native. We used React Navigation API to render a custom content component inside the drawer, and used the delimiter pattern for screen mapping. Use this pattern to build any level of nesting or conditional rendering for drawers.
